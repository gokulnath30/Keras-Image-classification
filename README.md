# Brain Tumor Prediction using keras image classification

* Collect the dataset and classified the data into folders. 
* To add the Folder path in load_data.py

## Prepare Dataset for Training
    py load_data.py
  
* The pickle file is Generated by load_data.py

## Train the Model 
    py train.py

* After Training the .h5 model is generated by train.py

## Inferace to check the model
    py predict.py
